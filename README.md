# HOME STUDIO DESIGNER: AN AUGMENTERED REALITY APPLICATION FOR DESIGNING YOUR MUSIC RECORDING STUDIO
## Introduction

Home studio Designer is an Augmented Reality (AR) application inspired by the ever more present furniture apps readily available on the market. As part of my university course Game development, we were tasked with implementing Unityâ€™s 3D tools as well as Machine learning (ML) algorithms to bring to life innovative AR/VR applications. Home Studio Designer was built on AR foundation with AR Core for Android and leverages popular pathfinding algorithms like BFS and A* as well as vocal recognition to search for furniture models influenced by user preferences.

## Documentation

Please refer to the report that details the architecture and various functions of the mobile application in the folder [Docs](https://github.com/JeanNSHUTI/Home-studio-designer/blob/main/Docs/Rapport_HomeStudioDesigner_56955_Outils3D_AR_ML.pdf) of this repo.

## Models

You will notice that the folder Assets/Models folder has been excluded via gitignore from the repo mainly due to its large size. However, if you want to try this app, please feel free to download the folder from my [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q5L4XD9eqxktTItHBFyFf0g6Zi_Ovn0s?usp=sharing) and then connect to your personal Google Bucket where you will have to place the contents of the folder [ServerData/Android/](https://github.com/JeanNSHUTI/Home-studio-designer/tree/main/ServerData/Android).
